      "This site turns a lecture into something you can actually use afterward. You'll walk through the slides at your own pace, and on each one you'll see small numbered circles marking the ideas worth digging into. Hover over a circle to preview the prompt; click it to copy a question tailored to your background. The star in the top-right corner of each slide is a master prompt that covers the whole slide. Every prompt you click gets collected into a single <code>.md</code> file you can download at the end.",
      "That file is your conversation starter. Upload it along with the original <code>.pptx</code> presentation into any LLM &mdash; Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, whichever you prefer &mdash; and it becomes a tutor that already knows who you are and what caught your attention."
